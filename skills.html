    <h1> Which Skills do your Students' Need to Practice? </h1>
    <p> The first step to create a useful and successful literature-based learning unit, is to determine which skills you want your students to practice throughout the unit. You can create a wonderful unit, but what is the use if your students are not gaining the necessary skills they need at this time. <br> Below you will find a list of common skills by age that you may wish to focus on during your unit. <br> You'll notice that many skills are listed under more than one age group. Children develop and gain skills in a predicable pattern <em> and </em> in their own timing so some children may be working on certain skills sooner or later than we expect. <br> <strong> Note </strong> This list is not exhaustive, but merely a jumping off point to help you starting thinking about skills your students may be working on too.  </p>
