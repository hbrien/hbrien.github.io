    <h1> How to Evaluate A Book </h1>
    <p> It can be intimidating to pick <em> one </em> book for a whole unit. Once you have in mind the skills want you want your students to work on, and a clear idea of their interests it becomes easier to narrow down which book would be a good jumping off point. <hr> The best books to base a unit around are multi-faceted. They speak to the main skill you want to practice, and they include other topics sprinkled that you can pull from as well. </p> <p> One of this author's favorite examples is <u> Stick and Stone</u> by Beth Ferry. Check it out here <a href="https://www.bethferry.com/stick-and-stone"> Stick and Stone </a>. This book covers themes of friendship and kindness <strong> and </strong> it also includes number sense, physics, nature exploration and more! After reading the story to the students you can see which parts are most interesting to them as we read and bring more projects on that topic to our classroom. <br> Take a look at some of the books that you already have with fresh eyes to see how many topics you can pull from one book. If you can see 4 or more topics, chances are it's a good candidate for a unit. </p>
