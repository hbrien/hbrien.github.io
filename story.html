    <h1>The <abbr title="Fire Demon Cat"> FDC </abbr> </h1>
    <h2> Chapter 1 </h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, a young gray kitten with tiny ears and large paws was born. The tiny kitten was alone and scared in the world and needed someone to take care of him. One day a goofy yet kind human came along and found the small gray kitten.</p> <blockquote>"Do you want to come home with me?" The human asked.</blockquote>
    <p> At once the kitten climbed up onto the human's shoulder, eager to set off on a new adventure.</p> <blockquote> "I will call you, Calcifur, the <abbr title="Fire Demon Cat">FDC</abbr>."</blockquote> </p>
    <br> <h2> Chapter 2 </h2>
    <p> Together they set off upon the road. Calcifur, riding upon the human's shoulder. Soon they came upon a <em>very</em> dark cave. They looked at one another. Even though they were both feeling <strong>scared</strong> They decided to go explore inside the cave. Once inside the human turned on a flashlight and guess what they found...?</p>
    <p> A <del> pile </del> <ins>mountain</ins> of <em> cat treats </em>! Oh what a glorious day for Calcifur, the fire demon cat.
